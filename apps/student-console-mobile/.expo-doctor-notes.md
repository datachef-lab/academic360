# Expo Doctor Warnings - Expected for pnpm Monorepo

## Metro Config Warnings (Safe to Ignore)

The following Metro config warnings are **expected and necessary** for pnpm monorepo setups:

- `resolver.disableHierarchicalLookup: true` - Required for pnpm workspace resolution
- `resolver.unstable_enableSymlinks: true` - Required for pnpm symlink handling

These settings are documented in Expo's monorepo guide and are safe to use. They enable proper package resolution across workspace boundaries.

## Package Version Warnings

If `expo install --check` reports "Dependencies are up to date" but expo-doctor still shows warnings, this is typically a false positive. The actual dependency versions are correct.

## Summary

✅ **Duplicate dependencies**: Fixed via pnpm overrides  
✅ **Package versions**: Verified via `expo install --check`  
⚠️ **Metro config**: Expected warnings for pnpm monorepo (safe to ignore)  
⚠️ **Package check**: May show false positives (verify with `expo install --check`)

These warnings will not cause runtime crashes or build failures.
